# iOS App Store Connect Summary:

CryptoMe is Venmo for cryptocurrency. For a long time, cryptocurrency has been considered a shady exchange of money between large complex addresses. Why does it have to be that way? CryptoMe attempts to personalize transactions, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrency with each other and write a description for their transactions.

### What's the difference?
The difference between CryptoMe and other "wallets" like Kraken and Crypto is that CryptoMe gives you access to your own wallet whereas those companies just put your money into their system, kind of like a bank. This is counterintuitive to the whole idea of cryptocurrency, which is decentralization as these “exchange wallets” are centralized to one of these companies. They say you have a wallet but they don't give you the secret key for your wallet, meaning you can't import that address to other sites or use that wallet without their application. You totally rely on their application to keep your money safe and to buy/sell/transfer money. In addition, hackers specifically target these large exchanges more than personal wallets, making your money much less secure. Robbers target banks much more than they target personal safes. CryptoMe puts the money in your own hands and gives you a secret key that is stored encrypted on your device and not with us. Recently, Ripple has introduced the Community Reach Support and Incentive Initiative to give XRP dividends to ripple holders, but only if they have a personal wallet as explained above, not an exchange wallet. Venmo uses a similar centralized structure. The money you have in Venmo belongs to Venmo in the larger scheme of things and bank transfers take days for you to actually possess your money. On top of that, Venmo is only usable in the USA whereas CryptoMe is global. In CryptoMe, you have your money right away, verified by millions of servers worldwide and the blockchain.

### Mode of transfer:
Currently the mode of transfer between users is XRP, or ripple. Ripple has one of the fastest transfer rates among all types of cryptocurrency. Transfers happen in a matter of seconds. It is a type of crypto that Banks rely on. No need to wait for bank clearances and slow processes, such as in Venmo. In the future, the app will allow other P2P crypto transfers including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

No collection of your Private Data:
CryptoMe does not collect private data, such as your driver's license or any identifying data because all transfers are with non-FIAT currency.

### Conversions:
Convert between 30+ types of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. into Ripple to store money into your CryptoMe wallet or withdraw Ripple as any of these cryptocurrencies.

Usage as a simple Ripple Wallet:
You can also send to other ripple addresses or receive from ripple addresses if the person you're sending or receiving from is not on the CryptoMe platform, just like in any other wallet app.

### Security:
The only thing you must keep secure is your secret key, which is used to make transactions. This key is with you and not with CryptoMe. Sites such as Kraken can get hacked and you can lose all your money or those companies can shut down/run away with all your money. With CryptoMe, your full wallet ownership means you can import or export your wallet into any application (e.g. into Gatehub), only you have your secret key, and only you can send money with that wallet.

### The future of CryptoMe:

- Having your own Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin wallet
- Sending Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin to your friends
- Send to your friends using their phone number
- Conversion of FIAT currency like dollars into cryptocurrency
- Login through facebook and social login
