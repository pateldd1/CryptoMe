# Summary:

CryptoMe is Venmo for cryptocurrency. For a long time, cryptocurrency has been considered a shady exchange of money between large complex addresses. Why does it have to be that way? Nowadays, millions of people are getting into crypto and ease-of-use/social payments will become more and more valuable. CryptoMe attempts to personalize transactions, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrency with each other and write a description for their transaction. Think Trust Wallet meets Venmo. CryptoMe want to make cryptocurrency payments P2P, P2B, and B2B as easy as possible by extracting away every point of failure, like large cryptocurrency addresses users must input, and letting the backend (our side) handle it. 

### What's the difference?
The difference between CryptoMe and cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX, Kraken, and Coinbase is that CryptoMe gives you access to your own wallet whereas those companies just put your money into their system, kind of like a bank (not a wallet). 

An example of this is the FTX exchange, which stole billions of dollars in crypto from it's users. Now imagine that happening to your money in Coinbase or Crypto.com (not likely but you're giving them your money to store it and use it). This is counterintuitive to the whole idea of cryptocurrency, which is decentralization as these exchanges are completely centralized. They say you have a wallet but they don't give you the secret key for your wallet, meaning you can't import that address to other sites or use that wallet without their application. You totally rely on their application to keep your money safe and to buy/sell/transfer money. CryptoMe allows you to leave our platform by deleting your wallet and importing it elsewhere, such as Gatehub. We're so sure you're going to like the user experience of CryptoMe that we allow you to leave and come back to the platform whenever you want. 

Venmo and Cashapp uses a similar centralized structure as these exchanges. The money you have in Venmo or Cashapp is just a number stored in a database, which could be changed by malicious actors who could also just delete your account. If anything like this happens to CryptoMe and you still have your secret key, you could just reimport your wallet onto another platform such as Gatehub. We're so sure you're going to like CryptoMe that we give you the option to leave whenever you want. In CryptoMe, you have your money right away, verified by millions of servers worldwide and the blockchain. On top of everything, Venmo is only usable in the USA whereas CryptoMe is global. 

Finally, hackers specifically target these large exchanges more than personal wallets, making your money much less secure. Robbers target banks much more than they target personal safes. CryptoMe puts the money in your own hands and gives you a secret key that is stored encrypted on your device and not with us. 

### Mode of transfer:
Currently the mode of transfer between users is XRP, or ripple. Ripple has one of the fastest transfer rates among all types of cryptocurrency. Transfers happen in a matter of seconds. It is a type of crypto that Banks rely on. No need to wait for bank clearances and slow processes, such as in Venmo. In the future, the app will allow other crypto transfers including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. However, our app will probably be used more for people who want to send XRP, XLM, Dogecoin, Shib, or even Algorand to each other since the mode of transfer happens in seconds and the price of the underlying asset will not change in those few seconds, whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum take minutes to transfer and their price can change in transit. Imagine paying your friend $10 in Bitcoin and while you wait for the transfer, Bitcoin loses 30% in value, meaning you only sent your friend $7. This is unacceptable and is a problem that can be solved using the aformentioned and fast assets like XRP or Doge. 

### No collection of your Private Data:
CryptoMe does not collect private data, such as your driver's license or any identifying data because all transfers are with non-FIAT currency.

### Conversions:
Convert between 200+ types of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. into Ripple to store money into your CryptoMe wallet or withdraw Ripple as any of these cryptocurrencies using the Changelly Api. 

### Usage as a simple Ripple Wallet:
You can also send to other ripple addresses or receive from ripple addresses if the person you're sending or receiving from is not on the CryptoMe platform, just like in any other wallet app. To increase user retention, instead of making these kinds of transfers, users will have to pay less in fees if the person they're trying to send money to is a part of the CryptoMe platform, so convince that person you're sending to to just be a part of the CryptoMe platform to avoid higher fees.

### Security:
The only thing you must keep secure is your secret key, which is used to make transactions. This key is with you and not with CryptoMe. Sites such as Kraken can get hacked and you can lose all your money or those companies can shut down/run away with all your money. With CryptoMe, your full wallet ownership means you can import or export your wallet into any application (e.g. into Gatehub), only you have your secret key, and only you can send money with that wallet. A person would literally need access to your phone, CryptoMe DB, and your CryptoMe password (basically impossible) to decrypt the encrypted secret key on your phone. If they don't have access to your phone and somehow log in as you on CryptoMe on their phone, they still couldn't use your money because the encrypted secret key isn't on their phone. Any payment they try to make with your account they hacked into on their device would fail because they don't have the encrypted secret key stored on their phone. 

### The future of CryptoMe:

- Having your own Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, DOGE, SHIB, ALGO, XLM, etc. wallet
- Sending Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin to your friends
- Send to your friends using their phone number
- Conversion of FIAT currency like dollars into cryptocurrency
- Login through facebook and social login
